## Lessons Learned

so thats was my first time approaching api from a .net platform, honestly it was really fun and opened up a whole new world for me, i feel like my projects scaleabillity should be a lot bigger once i will improve in web api.

* ive learned how to read api docu properly and not just scroll until i see the code that i need. 

* ive learnd how to create a service that interact between two different api's.

* ive learned that sometimes overthinking about something simple can overcomplicate it
